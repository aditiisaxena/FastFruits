FastFruit

Problem Statement-
Fruit lifecycle management to minimize wastage:
    The problem is to efficiently manage the lifecycle of the fruit in order to reduce the amount of fruits that are wasted in retail stores. This comprises keeping a close watch on the fruits' freshness, determining when they will go bad, and implementing measures in place to sell or discard the fruits before they spoil. To enhance retail operations and lower expenses overall, the system should account for factors including the fruits' variety, the store's inventory, and customer demand.

Project Scope:
    The primary aim of the project, i.e., an online retail store (for fruits and vegetables), is to create a centralized database system for managing inventory and sales of the goods, with the goal of improving efficiency and reducing waste.
