# FastFruits Online Retail Store
FastFruits is an online retail store that sells fruits and vegetables. We have tried to design the database and business logic layer for a Quick Commerce retail store specializing in fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are the most difficult Stock Keeping Unit category for most grocery companies owing to a standard wastage rate of 30%. Our system aims to minimize this wastage through algorithmic end-to-end lifecycle management of fruits and vegetables. <br>
This project is a database management system (DBMS) that has been built using MySQL and Flask to manage the data for FastFruits.
